# PongActionScriptMVCS

Harman Air<br/>
Starling<br/>
Feathers<br/>
Robotlegs<br/>
Swiftsuspenders<br/>

Back down to the memory lane :)

ActionScript 3 experiment I made in 2014. Small Pong clone that utilizes the Robotlegs MVC pattern with Stage3D and Signals.

EDIT 2025: Upgraded Harman Adobe Air (51.2.1.0) and switched it to Visual Studio Code.<br/>

Used source instead of precompiled libraries, as I tweaked a few things.
